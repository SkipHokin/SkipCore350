SkipCore350 Project Context & Vision

Project Name: SkipCore350
Type: Open Source CoreXY 3D Printer
Build Volume: 350mm x 350mm x 350mm
Lead: Skip Hokin (aka "Skip")

‚ú® Vision Statement

To design and build a high-performance, low-cost, fully enclosed CoreXY 3D printer using open-source principles, V-slot extrusions, and widely available components. SkipCore350 aims to be:

Builder-friendly and easily replicable

Mechanically robust with smooth motion (MGN12 rails + GT2 9mm belts)

Modular and maintainable

Capable of printing engineering-grade filaments

Designed for clean enclosure and cable management

The goal is to offer makers a DIY alternative to high-end machines, blending the precision of industrial designs with the accessibility of community-driven innovation.

üìä Project Overview

SkipCore350 is a fusion of SimpleCore-style motion with modern practices:

CoreXY motion system for speed and accuracy

Triple Z leadscrew driven by a single stepper via GT2 belt

Full 2020/2040 V-slot aluminum frame

MGN12H rails on all axes for rigidity and future upgradeability

Compatibility with BTT Pad7 and SKR-based boards

Designed around off-the-shelf parts and printable brackets

Future-proofed to support direct-drive or Bowden extruders, enclosure panels, toolheads, and more.

üèãÔ∏è Key Milestones

Frame assembly and CAD layout (Blender)

Release of printable STLs for motion and brackets

BOM creation and sourcing notes (Aliexpress, local)

Wiring + electronics integration

Functional build and print validation

Documentation, GitHub publishing, and community feedback

üöÄ Intended Use

Perfect for:

Functional prototyping

Mechanical parts and jigs

Enclosed prints (ABS, ASA, PC)

Builders seeking a dependable, modifiable platform

Whether you‚Äôre a hobbyist, educator, or small-shop maker, SkipCore350 aims to be a reliable workhorse you can understand, build, and tweak as needed.

üí™ Let‚Äôs Build Something Great

SkipCore350 is more than just a printer ‚Äî it‚Äôs a collaborative process. A chance to explore design, motion, and fabrication from the ground up. With the right mix of smarts, patience, and 9mm belts, we'll build a machine that punches well above its budget.
